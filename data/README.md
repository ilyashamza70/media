# Data Directory

This directory stores data and log files generated by the Grade Calculator application.

## Files

### simulation_log.json
JSON log file containing the history of all grade calculations and simulations.

Format:
```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "20251108_214009",
    "degree_course": "Embedded Systems",
    "degree_type": "magistrale",
    "weighted_average": 29.13,
    "arithmetic_average": 28.36,
    "graduation_grade": 108.32,
    "statistics": {...},
    "grades": {...}
  }
]
```

### simulation_log.pkl
Pickle format backup of simulation logs (legacy support).

## Generated Files

The application may also generate additional files in this directory:
- `grade_analysis_*.png` - Visualization charts
- `results_*.json` - Detailed results exports
- `grades_*.csv` - Grade tables in CSV format

## Note

Files in this directory are automatically managed by the application. You typically don't need to modify them manually.

The simulation logs allow you to view your calculation history using the "Visualizza storico" option in the application.
